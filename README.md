# kaggle-deep-learning-competition

My first go at manipulating data in pandas and training a deep learning model in pytorch. 

I tried to be cheeky by purposely not-using SOTA transformers and that got me a whopping ~8.5% final cross-validation score. But I'm not gonna lie this was an incredibly fun experience and I definitely want to have another crack at a deep-learning competition when I get the time for it.

To predict enzyme stability at differnt temperatures I used a modified version of a CNN (sort of similar to AlexNet) before finally running the results outputted from the model into a quick-sort algorithm.
